as GRUB).

* Interrupts
* Process scheduling
* VBE graphics
* PS2 Mouse/Keyboard
* VFS
* ext2 filesystem
* DevFS
* UNIX sockets
* libc
* Window Manager
* Terminal Emulator
* Very basic shell
* Shell utilities(cat, yes, echo etc)

and some other stuff.

## How do I run it?

You shouldn't, it is very incomplete and does not have much interesting
sutff in the userland yet. Setup is currently also slightly painful if
you don't know what you are doing.

## Why?
