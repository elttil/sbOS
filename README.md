# sbOS

A mostly from scratch, UNIX like x86 hobbyist operaing system. Kernel,
libc and the rest of the userland are written from scratch. It only
requires a bootloader that supports the first version of multiboot(such
as GRUB).

## Features

* Paging
* Interrupts
* Process scheduling
* VBE graphics
* PS2 Mouse/Keyboard
* VFS
* ext2 filesystem
* DevFS
* UNIX sockets
* libc
* Window Manager
* Terminal Emulator
* Very basic shell
* Shell utilities(cat, yes, echo etc)

and some other stuff.

## How do I run it?

You shouldn't, it is very incomplete and does not have much intreasting
sutff in the userland yet. Setup is currently also sligthly painful if
you don't know what you are doing.

## Why?

fun
